X. Evaluation of Service Organization Controls

In addition to the primary IT audit scope, we will evaluate the service organization controls at HRP-For-All, a third-party service organization in Austin, Texas, responsible for human resources and payroll services for Starfield. Deloitte, the service auditor, has recently issued a report assessing the controls at HRP-For-All for the period July 1, 20XX, through June 30, 20XX. The report found that controls at HRP-For-All were effective.

The details of the evaluation of service organization controls are presented below:

| Service Organization | Brief Description of Relevant Service Provided | Service Organization Control | Service Auditor | Report Period | Report Type |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| HRP-For-All         | Human resources and payroll services         | Data security and access controls | Deloitte       | July 1, 20XX to June 30, 20XX | Type of Report |

XI. Other Areas for IT Audit Assistance

In our previous discussions and in line with our initial assessment, we identified the following areas where IT auditors can potentially provide valuable assistance for Starfield:

1. **Cybersecurity Assessment**: Given the increasing cyber threats in the industry, it is crucial to assess the effectiveness of the organization's cybersecurity controls, including intrusion detection systems, firewall configurations, and incident response procedures.

2. **Data Privacy Compliance**: Ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA, is critical. We will evaluate how the company manages and protects sensitive customer and employee data.

3. **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery**: Assessing the adequacy of the company's business continuity and disaster recovery plans, including data backup processes and the ability to recover IT systems in case of a disruption.

4. **IT Governance and Policies**: Reviewing the IT governance framework and policies to ensure they align with industry best practices and support the company's strategic goals.

These areas should be considered in addition to our primary focus on supporting the financial statement audit and evaluating service organization controls. We will further discuss these potential areas of assistance with the client to determine the scope and priority of any additional IT audit work.

XII. Integration with the IT Audit Plan

The identification of these additional areas for IT audit assistance does not replace our primary focus on supporting the financial statement audit. However, it is important to remain attentive to opportunities where IT can add value and enhance the organization's overall IT governance and risk management.

Please incorporate this addendum into the IT Audit Planning Memo and ensure that it is considered as we engage with Starfield. If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out.
